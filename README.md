# cruzhacks-FEchallenge

> A small submission for the front-end challenge for CruzHacks organizer position.

## Prerequisites

This project requires [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) for using React. To make sure you have them available on your machine, try running the following command like so.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
9.6.3
v19.8.1
```

If you don't get a version number for both, please first follow the guides to [installation on NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [npm installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

I used the library [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as well, so that library will need to be installed like so:

```sh
$ npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
